# üß† Brain Tumour Detection with CNN & Flask

Welcome to the Brain Tumour Detection project! This project leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify brain tumours based on MRI images, providing insights to support healthcare professionals. With an easy-to-use Flask interface, users can upload their own MRI images or select random samples from the dataset for classification and information.

## üîç Introduction
This project aims to assist healthcare professionals by automating the detection of brain tumuors using MRI images. Utilizing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, the model classifies images into three categories of tumors or identifies if no tumor is present. We also leveraged explainable AI techniques such as LIME in order for interpretability of the decisions made by the model and this was done using a pretrained model which is EfficientNet B1. The Flask app provides a user-friendly interface for uploading MRI scans and receiving classification results, offering essential insights and explanations.

## üåü Project Features
- **Upload MRI Images**: Users can upload their own MRI images for classification.
- **Random Image Selection**: Select random images from the dataset to test the model‚Äôs accuracy.
- **Classification and Explanation**: The model identifies the tumor type and gives additional information on the tumor class using an integrated AI assistant.
- **Future Integration of Explainable AI**: Future plans include integrating LIME into the app to provide visual explanations of model predictions.
